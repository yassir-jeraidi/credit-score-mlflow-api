\chapter{Conclusion}

The \textbf{Intelligent Credit Scoring API} successfully demonstrates how modern Machine Learning and MLOps practices can transform financial risk assessment. By moving away from static rules to dynamic, data-driven models, we achieved higher predictive accuracy, particularly in identifying high-risk profiles.

Critically, the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) ensures that this performance does not come at the cost of transparency. The system respects the "black box" constraints by shedding light on the decision-making process, making it a viable tool for real-world regulated environments.

Future work will focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrating alternative data sources (e.g., transactional data) to further improve scoring.
    \item Implementing A/B testing strategies in production to refine model thresholds.
    \item Exploring real-time learning (Online Learning) to adapt to changing economic conditions instantly.
\end{itemize}
